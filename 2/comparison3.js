// QUESTION 3

// DIRECTIONS FOR THIS PROBLEM:

// Compute the number of comparisons (as in Problem 1), using the "median-of-three" pivot rule. 
// [The primary motivation behind this rule is to do a little bit of extra work to get much 
// better performance on input arrays that are nearly sorted or reverse sorted.] In more detail,
// you should choose the pivot as follows. Consider the first, middle, and final elements of the 
// given array. (If the array has odd length it should be clear what the "middle" element is; for i
// an array with even length 2k, use the kth element as the "middle" element. So for the array 
// 4 5 6 7, the "middle" element is the second one ---- 5 and not 6!) Identify which of these three 
// elements is the median (i.e., the one whose value is in between the other two), and use this as 
// your pivot. As discussed in the first and second parts of this programming assignment, be sure to 
// implement Partition exactly as described in the video lectures (including exchanging the pivot 
// element with the first element just before the main Partition subroutine).

// EXAMPLE: For the input array 8 2 4 5 7 1 you would consider the first (8), middle (4), and last (1) 
// elements; since 4 is the median of the set {1,4,8}, you would use 4 as your pivot element.

// SUBTLE POINT: A careful analysis would keep track of the comparisons made in identifying the median 
// of the three candidate elements. You should NOT do this. That is, as in the previous two problems, 
// you should simply add mâˆ’1 to your running total of comparisons every time you recurse on a subarray
//  with length m.

    // lines = fs.readFileSync('./tests/1000.txt').toString().split("\n").filter(Boolean).map(Number), // Comparisons: 8921
